**Remaining tasks**

**Exception handling**
Needed exception handling for all layers so that meaningful message can be sent to the user

**Asynchronous HTTP call**
Due to time constraint, could not implement asynchronous http call. Was looking at below link to implement the same functionality in this API
https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client

**Test coverage**
Next steps - yet to complete writing test for services layers etc

Validation for passengers count, discount/tax calculation are yet to be completed
